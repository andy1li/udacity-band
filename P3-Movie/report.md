- #### **Question 1 Story:** How have movie genres changed over time?

  Over the 55 years from 1960 to 2015, Drama, Comedy and Thriller have almost always been the most dominating genres in terms of numbers of movies made. In 1960 the most financially successful genre was (unexpectedly) History with an average adjusted revenues of \$88 millions, and the most rated genre was Family with an average rating of 7.3. In 2015 it was Adventure (\$182 million) and Documentary (7.007) respectively.

- #### **Question 2 Story:** How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures?

  Paramoun's movies tended to perform more extremely than those of Universal, as it has the top 3 highest grossing genres (Adventure, Science Fiction and Action) and also the lowest one (Western) excluding the outlier Foreign genre. In general, Paramount beats Universal financially in 14 out of the 20 total genres (with the exceptions of Animation, Fantasy, Family, War, Horror and Western). And Paramount has a larger share of the top 100 grossing movies made by all companies.

- #### **Question 4:** What are the most successful movies of all time?

  After questions about broad strokes about genres and companies, I'd like to delve into the movies as they are individually. If defined as financially successful, the top 3 movies are no doubt Star Wars in 1977, Titanic in 1997, and Avatar in 2009. It is also noteworthy that the top 100 grossing movies are dominated by the genres of Action and Adventure.
